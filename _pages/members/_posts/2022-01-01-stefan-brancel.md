Stefan graduated from the University of Minnesota with a BS in Neuroscience and Psychology and minors in Chemistry and Sustainable Studies. He specialized within the Luciana lab as a neuroimaging analyst for MRI, DTI, and resting fMRI. His primary work in the lab was on brain anatomy and connectivity correlates of working memory across adolescent development. This followed his broader interests in understanding how the brain produces complex behaviors and how neurological deficits lead to behavioral deficits. Stefan is currently attending medical school at Indiana University. When he is not immersed in his studies and research, he is an avid juggler.

Stefan recently graduated from Indiana University with his M.D. specializing in radiology.
