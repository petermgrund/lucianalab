Liz Olson received her Ph.D. in clinical psychology from the University of Minnesota in 2009. She is currently Instructor in Psychology at McLean Hospital/Harvard Medical School where she conducts research as part of the Anxiety and Traumatic Stress Disorders Laboratory. Lizâ€™s graduate research focused on neural underpinnings of prosocial behavior and on structural brain correlates of delay discounting behavior in the context of adolescent development. Her dissertation involved behavioral and neuroimaging analyses of longitudinal delay and probability discounting and neuroimaging data, demonstrating within-subject change in delay discounting but not probability discounting over the course of adolescent development. She completed a pre-doctoral internship and a two-year post-doctoral fellowship in adult clinical neuropsychology.

She is currently a researcher in the Center for Depression, Anxiety and Stress Research, where she has expanded her ability to use multimodal neuroimaging techniques as well as behavioral paradigms to examine mechanisms underlying mood and anxiety disorders. She is increasingly interested in the neurobiological basis for alterations in social behavior following trauma exposure.
