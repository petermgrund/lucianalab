Paul Collins is a Research Associate in  the Department of Psychology at the University of Minnesota. He obtained his B.A. in Psychology from Harvard University in 1984 and worked in research laboratories at the Massachusetts General Hospital before relocating to Minnesota to attend graduate school. He obtained his Ph.D. in 1993 from the University of Minnesota’s clinical psychology program where he specialized in studying dopaminergic underpinnings of positive emotionality with a particular interest in neurodevelopment and in the psychophysiological correlates of behavioral processes. Paul joined the faculty of the clinical psychology program at the University of Oregon, where he ran an ERP lab, using a 128-channel electrical geodesic system.  He returned to the University of Minnesota’s Department of Psychology in 2001, and serves as a co-investigator on current projects. Paul brings expertise in psychophysiology, high-density EEG/ERP data collection and analysis, the psychometrics of personality function, and the high level analysis of brain imaging data to our projects.
