Nirvi Ajmera graduated from the University of Minnesota with a B.S. in psychology and minors in integrative neuroscience, statistics, and child psychology. She joined the lab in January 2018 and assisted with a variety of tasks including examining functional magnetic resonance images pre-analysis for quality, assisting in the data collection of current studies, and carrying out an independent research project on the longitudinal impacts of marijuana initiation on verbal learning and memory. In her spare time, she enjoys the occasional jigsaw puzzle, hiking and exploring national parks, and taking lots of pictures along the way.

Nirvi is currently a graduate student at the University of Miami in the Adult Clinical program with a health concentration.
