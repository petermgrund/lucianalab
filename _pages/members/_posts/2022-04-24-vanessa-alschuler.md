Vanessa Alschuler is a 1st year graduate student in the Clinical Science and Psychopathology Research program. She earned her B.A. in Neurobiology from the University of California, Berkeley. Her early research included animal models of altruistic and pro-social behaviors. After graduating, she focused on longitudinal neurodevelopmental studies with adolescents and teens, as well as sleep and other physiological-based explorations. Her current interests lie in the connections between brain and behavior with an emphasis on executive functioning, sex differences in neurodevelopment, and the role that genes and hormones play in developmental processes. In her free time, she likes to go on long walks with her dog, Teagan, dance, and cook/bake.
