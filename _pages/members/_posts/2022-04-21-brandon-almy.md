Brandon Almy is a graduate of the Developmental Psychopathology and Clinical Science program. Before joining the lab in 2014, he earned a B.S. in Psychology at Brown University and spent two years working as a research assistant in the Department of Psychiatry and Human Behavior at Rhode Island Hospital (RIH). Projects at RIH included assessing the efficacy of a school-based emotion regulation intervention and conducting community-based research on school-based physical and mental health resources. During graduate school, his research focused on longitudinal changes in adolescent decision-making  and computational models of decision-making during the Iowa Gambling Task. Clinically, he is interested in pediatric neuropsychological assessment and potential applications of computational modeling. He is currently a postdoctoral fellow at Michigan Medicine/University of Michigan. In his free time, he likes to sample different coffees, play board games, and bike on roads and trails.
