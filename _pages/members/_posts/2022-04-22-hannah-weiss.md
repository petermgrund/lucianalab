Hannah Weiss is a 4th year graduate student in the Clinical Science and Psychopathology Research program. Before joining the lab in 2017, she earned a B.S. in Neuroscience with a minor in Mathematics at Bates College and spent two years working on neuroimaging and TMS projects in the National Institute on Drug Abuse's postbaccalaureate training program. Early research focus in the lab focused on insula resting state connectivity and behavioral correlates in adolescence, and current research will explore longitudinal aspects of impulsivity, alcohol use, and brain correlates in adolescence. Clinically, she is interested in neuropsychological assessment and working with diverse populations. In her free time, she likes to cuddle with her dog, Sirius, play board games, and watching television.
