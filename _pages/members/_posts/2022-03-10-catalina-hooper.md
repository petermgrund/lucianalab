Catalina obtained her Ph.D. in clinical psychology from the University of Minnesota in 2008. Following an internship in neuropsychology at the University of Iowa, she pursued clinical licensure and is currently a practicing neuropsychology in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, where she specializes in physical medicine and rehabilitation. Catalina’s graduate work focused on the development of motivated decision making, as measured by the Iowa Gambling Task, in adolescents. Her dissertation was an analysis of brain structural correlates of reversal learning behavior in children, adolescents and young adults. She was instrumental in the design and set-up of the lab’s current longitudinal work.
