Peter Grund is a senior pursuing a B.S. in psychology and a minor in integrative neuroscience. He joined the lab in May 2019 to gain experience administering cognitive and neuropsychological tasks and for a better understanding of statistical analyses. Peter is interested in the neurobiological influences of substance use on adolescent brain development, as well as psychiatric genetics. He is coordinating two of the lab's current projects and assists in behavioral testing and data collection. He is carrying out an independent research project on the long-term effects of alcohol and cannabis use on adolescent/young adult impulsivity, as well as a project investigating the neural correlates of delay discounting. Peter also manages the BBPL lab website.

In addition to his participation in the Brain and Behavioral Processes Lab, Peter works as a data manager for the Minnesota Center for Twin and Family Research and is a part of a study at the Minneapolis VA attempting to use genetics as a predictor of mild traumatic brain injury treatment outcomes, as well as the role that they play in internalizing psychopathology. He is also a TA for the Human Neuroanatomy (NSCI 2101) lab section.

Outside of his research and academic work, Peter enjoys reading, contributing to Wikipedia, and staying active in local politics. After completing his undergraduate work, Peter plans to participate in postbaccalaruate research and shortly thereafter apply to a clinical graduate program.
