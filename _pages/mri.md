Your safety and comfort throughout the MRI experience is our top priority. Since the MRI is an extremely powerful magnet, metal and products that contain metal must be removed before the scan to assure your safety. On the day of your scan, study personnel will go over an extensive metal checklist with you to ensure that no metal is brought into the MRI scan room. In addition, we have provided additional guidelines to assure that your data will be of high quality. Please assist us with this process by using the following guidelines to prepare for your MRI.

### Metal

*  Please notify our staff prior to your appointment if you may have any metallic material in your body such as surgical pins, plates, clips, IUD, or any other foreign objects.
* You will be asked to remove jewelry, belts, bobby pins, makeup, credit cards, cell phones, splints, braces, wrap bandages or any other metal objects that might interfere with the magnetic field of the MRI scanner. To assist with the metal screening process, please avoid bringing any metal objects that you will not need that day (e.g., lighters, pocket-knifes, paperclips, etc.). 


### Clothing

* Please wear comfortable clothing that is free of zippers, snaps, metallic threads and/or other metallic decorations.
* We recommend sweat pants and a long-sleeved shirt. The scan room is sometimes on the cool side. Please note that you will be required to change into scrubs during the scan.
* Females: Please wear a sports bra (or a bra that does not have any metal/underwires). If you wear an underwire bra on the day of your scan, we will ask you to remove it.
* Please do not wear headbands or hair binders of any type.  


### Tattoos

Please notify study personnel of any tattoos prior to your scheduled MRI.  


### Transdermal (Skin) Patches

* Any transdermal patches (e.g., Birth Control patch, Nicotine patch, Nitro patch, Fentanyl patch, etc.) must be removed for the MRI scan.
* Please consult your physician prior to removing the patch.
* Inform study staff if the patch cannot be removed. We will not scan you with a transdermal patch in place.   


### Hair Care/Makeup

* Please do not wear the following items to your appointment:
    * Nail polish (especially metallic shades/designs). All fingernail polish will need to be removed before you can be scanned; any metallic finger or toenail polish will need to be removed as well
    * Makeup: Do not wear makeup to your appointment, especially eye makeup of any type; we will require you to remove it before the scan
    * Hair products (e.g., gels, mousse, hairspray, etc.; products that contain heavy amounts of mineral oil are not recommended)
    * Hair accessories (e.g., bobby pins, clips, hair ties, headbands, etc.)
    * Artificial eyelashes
    * Permanent eyeliner: we will not scan you if you have permanent eyeliner
    * Hair extensions and/or wigs: Please inform us if you wear these products.
* It is best if you arrive with clean dry hair. Please try to wash your hair the evening before (or the morning of) the scan.  


### Pregnancy

Although there are no known risks associated with pregnancy, we will not scan someone who is pregnant.

* Please inform study personnel if there is a possibility you may be pregnant.
* We will do a urine pregnancy test prior to scanning.
