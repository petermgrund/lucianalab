<h2><a id="faq"></a>Frequently asked questions</h2>
<h5>Will I ever receive any feedback or results from the DNA study? If no, why not?</h5>
<p>No, unfortunately that is not possible. First, to protect your confidentiality, your samples will 
  de-identified through the use of a meaningless ID code. This important privacy measure makes it impossible 
  to provide individual results by matching samples with findings. Secondly, our Humans Subjects Committee 
  forbids us from providing such feedback, in part because we do not know ahead of time what we will find, 
  what significance it will have, or how people will deal with it.</p>

<h5>What will the blood eventually be used for?</h5>
<p>Genes are essentially instructions that your body uses to build proteins that carry out various functions 
  in your body. Some proteins affect how the brain works. Others affect how well you can metabolise drugs, such
  as medical cannabis.</p>
