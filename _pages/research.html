            Brain neuroplasticity and behavioral development in adolescence

        </p>Adolescence is widely conceptualized as a period of time when individuals engage in more risk-taking behavior, at least as compared to childhood and adulthood. 
            The reasons for this increase have not been fully explained from a scientific perspective. Within our lab, we are investigating the longitudinal development of 
            executive functions, such as working memory, planning, and inhibitory control, in typically-developing 
            adolescents as a function of both age and pubertal development. The literature suggests that these abilities 
            improve at a steady rate through adolescence and into adulthood.</p>

        <p>We are also examining brain structure in relation to the development of executive function.  Brain-based changes commonly observed through adolescence include declines in cortical gray matter, declines in cortical thickness, increases in white matter extent, and evidence of increased fronto-striatal connectivity. In our work, we have attempted to define links between these normative neurodevelopmental processes and behavior.</p>
            
        <p>In recent years, models of adolescent development have expanded from a primary focus on executive function and its development to the consideration of motivational factors that also impact behavior. In our lab, we are most interested in positive motivation--that is, the circumstances under which people pursue positive goals and rewards. Our group has theorized that positive motivation has a basis in the brain’s dopamine system, and our group has described the circuitry involved in this association. We have hypothesized that increases in dopamine activity underlie a shift that occurs during adolescence where sensitivity to positive incentives increases before declining to more typical levels as adulthood is reached. Our work coheres with other dual systems models of adolescent development in suggesting (a) that adolescence is a period of time when positive incentive motivation exerts a strong influence over behavior and (b) that this drive is difficult for the still-developing prefrontal cortex to fully control. This work has implications for many forms of psychopathology that emerge during adolescence.</p>

            Disrupted development of neural connections following alcohol use initiation in adolescents
          </button>

          <p>Adolescence is a critical period for the emergence of clinical problems, such as substance abuse and dependence.  Adult studies have demonstrated adverse effects of chronic heavy alcohol use on brain structure and function. However, little research exists regarding how initiation of alcohol use interacts with neurodevelopmental processes that are active in adolescence. Given that a large majority of adolescents initiate alcohol use, a key question is how this initiation disrupts the developmental fine tuning of brain connectivity patterns. We are examining this question through a longitudinal project funded by the National Institute of Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism and National Institute on Drug Abuse. Our work to date indicates that alcohol use initiation is associated with declines in cortical thickness in the frontal lobe, with deviations in white matter development in posterior cortical regions, and with disrupted white matter connectivity in the striatum and periventricular regions.

            Longitudinal brain and behavioral effects of marijuana use in adolescent-onset users

          <p>In addition to alcohol, marijuana is one of the most commonly used substances of abuse among adolescents and young adults. Its effects on the brain and on behavior are poorly understood. Funded by the National Institute on Drug Abuse and NIAAA, we are examining the longitudinal impacts of heavy chronic marijuana use in college-aged individuals who began to use the drug when they were teenagers. Findings to date suggest that heavy marijuana use is associated with disruptions in working memory, planning skills, verbal learning and memory, and motivated decision-making. We also find evidence of disruption in the young adult development of frontal white matter tracts and in striatal glutamate activity.</p>

          <p>The University of Minnesota is a performance site for the 21-site ABCD Consortium, which has enrolled nearly 12,000 families. Together with Professor Bill Iacono who co-directs the Minnesota Center for Twin and Family Research, Monica Luciana oversees the University of Minnesota’s ABCD performance site, which is following singletons and twins, ages 9-10.
