# Luciana Lab website re-design
This is the GitHub repo for a new website being developed for the Brain and Behavioral Processes Laboratory (Luciana Lab) at the University of Minnesota. The primary developer on this project is Peter Grund.

This site will be run using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), a [Ruby](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_(programming_language)) gem. It will also incorporate [Bootstrap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootstrap_(front-end_framework)).
